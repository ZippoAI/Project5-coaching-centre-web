Act as a senior UI/UX designer and front-end engineer. Build a high-end, premium coaching centre website that feels modern, trustworthy, and aspirational.

Delivery Constraint (critical)
• Send all code in a single HTML file
• Inline CSS and JavaScript inside the same file
• No external frameworks or build tools

Tech Stack (mandatory)
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid) for layout
Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
GSAP for smooth, high-impact animations

Design & Experience Goals
• Ultra-premium, professional look
• Strong brand presence with refined visual hierarchy
• Elegant dark-based color theme with tasteful accent colors
• Clean typography, strong spacing, polished UI components
• Must feel human-designed — not AI-generated

Layout Requirement
Single-page website that visually and logically behaves like a 5-page experience, using smooth scrolling and section-based navigation:

Home / Hero

About the Coaching Centre

Courses / Programs

Faculty / Mentors (use realistic placeholder profiles)

Contact / Enquiry

Core Components

• Reusable, scalable CSS
• Lightweight, performant JavaScript

Deliver a website that looks like it was built by a premium digital agency for a top-tier coaching institute — refined, confident, and conversion-focused.
